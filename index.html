          Hello, 
          Thanks for taking a look at my application.
          My favorite thing is sitting down with you about what is required to achieve your project goals. What is really bugging you? Let's solve it together. Maybe we'll cut costs, perhaps we'll improve revenue, or perhaps we will do both. 
          I specialize in steamy romance content development, and my services can fit into a wide range of purposes. With over 5 years of romance content writing experience, I commit to delivering unique, quality, and excellent content with
          unflinching respect for deadlines.
          I have seen your job description, and I am able and ready to give you the best service.
          My write-ups will no doubt engage your audience and spur them to take the actions necessary to achieve the goals of this project. Some of my previous works are attached so you can have a feel of how I write. I can also provide more as need
          be. I eagerly look forward to working with you.</p>
